# initial_lettice is a two dimensional array of states (0,1)
# rules is a 2d matrix with 2 rows: the first row states the probabilities for getting sick,
#                                   the second one states the probabilities for becoming healthy.
# max_t defines the maximum number of steps
# Returns: the lettice after the last step
